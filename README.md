# Cordova System Sound Plugin


This is a simple plugin to play sound for iOS. The main motivation for creating this plugin is to play DTMF feedback sound while using https://github.com/BasqueVoIPMafia/cordova-plugin-iosrtc. The dtmfSender interface in cordova-plugin-iosrtc does not give the users audio feedback. Other plugins out there does not take consideration of a voip call in session and end up taking over the audio. 

## Installation

In your root Cordova project

```bash
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-system-sound-services
```

Make sure you have your-sound-file.wav imported to the ios target as a part of your build process so it exists when you run build ios command. 

## Usage

Somewhere after/before running your DTMF function 

```
window.SystemSound.playSound('your-sound-file.wav');
```

If you sound is not located in the root of the xcode project

```
window.SystemSound.playSound('your-sound-file.wav', 'path/to/folder/with/sounds');
```
